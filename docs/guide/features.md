GMEME Arena is a futuristic Web3 battle game where strategy meets meme culture. Here is comprehensive guide to all game features.

## 3. 💰 Swap & Crowdfunding
The built-in Swap isn't just a DEX—it's our **Community Crowdfunding Mechanism**.

- **Fair Launch**: Everyone buys GMEME at the same dynamic rate based on supply and demand.
- **🚀 Official Listing**: When the Swap Pool runs out of GMEME, it means the crowdfunding phase is complete. We will then take the raised POL liquidity to **list GMEME officially** on major DEXs (Uniswap/QuickSwap).
- **💸 Play-to-Earn**: Battle winners can **sell their GMEME rewards instantly** back to the Swap Pool for POL at any time, even during the crowdfunding phase.
