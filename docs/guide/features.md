# Game Features

GMEME Arena is a futuristic Web3 battle game where strategy meets meme culture. Here is comprehensive guide to all game features.

## 1. The Arena (Active Battles)
This is the heart of the game. Here you can join live battles or watch others fight.

- **Join Queue**: Select your fighter to enter the matchmaking queue.
- **Entry Fee**: **10 GMEME** per battle.
- **Matchmaking**: The system automatically pairs you with the next available opponent.
- **Rewards**:

## 2. Mint Fighter (Create NFT)
Before you can fight, you need a champion.

- **Cost**: **1 GMEME** per mint.
- **Upload**: Choose any image to represent your fighter. We upload it securely to IPFS.
- **Metadata**: Your fighter is minted as a unique ERC-721 NFT on the Polygon blockchain.
- **Starting Stats**: All fighters start with **Rank: Bronze** and **ELO: 0**.

## 3. GME Battles (No Entry Fee)
Experience battle mode without spending any GMEME! Perfect for new players to practice and earn rewards.

### How It Works
- **Entry Fee**: **FREE** (No GMEME required to join)
- **Requirement**: You must hold at least **1 GMEME** in your wallet to participate (anti-spam protection)
- **Daily Limit**: **3 battles per day** per wallet
- **Battle Duration**: **5 Minutes** (Quick battles!)
- **Matchmaking**: Same as premium battles - auto-paired with available opponents

### Rewards

- **Losing Voters**: No rewards (0 GME)

### What is GME?
**$GME** is our utility token for the GME Battles mode.

- **Use Case**: Used for rewards in GME Free Battles
- **Airdrops**: $GME will be used for future community airdrops
- **Migration**: $GME tokens will be **migrated to become the main $GMEME token** in a future update. Hold your $GME to receive the official $GMEME airdrop!

## 4. Swap & Crowdfunding
The built-in Swap isn't just a DEX—it's our **Community Crowdfunding Mechanism**.

- **Pool Allocation**: 600,000 GMEME (90% Supply) is allocated to the Swap Pool.
- **Fair Launch**: Everyone buys GMEME at the same dynamic rate based on supply and demand.
- **Official Listing**: When the Swap Pool runs out of GMEME, it means the crowdfunding phase is complete. We will then take the raised POL liquidity to **list GMEME officially** on major DEXs (Uniswap/QuickSwap).
- **Play-to-Earn**: Battle winners can **sell their GMEME rewards instantly** back to the Swap Pool for POL at any time, even during the crowdfunding phase.

> **Opportunity**: Early adopters who buy from the Swap Pool support the project's foundation.
